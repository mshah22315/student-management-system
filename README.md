This is a Student Management System developed in Java. The technologies used were Java Swing, Java AWT, Java AWT Event, and MySQL. I have provided SQL dump files containing the necessary databases for this project
For the proper order of execution, you must first run the TitleScreen class. That will lead you to the AdminLogin class, and then, if admin credentials provided are valid, the MainPage class. 
From there, you can access any of the four operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for adjusting the table containing student information.
Note that you will have to add admin credentials within your MySQL Workbench.
